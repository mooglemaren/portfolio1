# Portfolio 1

This is a basic site to provide information on past projects. I plan on expanding and refurbishing it in time, keep an eye out!

# Description
For the course "portfolio 1" our assignment called for a site to showcase some of the projects that have been created and built upon over the course of the school year. To start off, this site will be a bit bare-bones, but in time I am hoping to display more funky apps here.
